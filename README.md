# QueueToDo
Manage your everyday tasks in the right order.

## Description
Increase your productivity by organizing your tasks in the most natural way -
by queueing them. Stop procrastinating and let the app engage you to do tasks
without the possibility to change their order.

## Usage
Just press the wide blue button and 'Push a task' which basically creates an
empty task and adds it to the queue. Fill a title and expand it to provide more
data in a description field. Is a task already done? Just click the
'Pop the first task' button above the queue and remove the first task.
Forget about tapping the 'Save' button. There is nothing like that. Everything
happens on the fly.
